I lived in a home with a family that had kids but due to my history of using my mouth when I am uncomfortable, my caregivers are recommending that I go to an adult only home.<p></p><p></p>I prefer the &quot;hands-off&quot; approach, meaning that I will jump on your lap and interact, but it's all on my terms. I tend to get feisty if I get too much attention....typical catitude! I am very food motivated and love snacks and toys.  If you want a cool cat, come adopt me!<p></p><p></p>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p></p><p></p>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p></p><p></p>1)     This cat has a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  He is currently being treated with oral steroids.  This condition will require long term management, which could include medications and prescription diets.  We recommend you follow up with your regular veterinarian for the best treatment plan.

My name is Roxy and I am available for adoption.<p></p><p></p>I was brought in by my previous owner on August 19, 2017 because sometimes I went to the bathroom outside the litter box. <p></p><p></p>My personality color is BLUE.

Because I can't protect myself outside, I need to be an indoor-only cat.<p></p><p></p>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p></p><p></p>1)     House soiling:  This cat has a long history of house soiling (primarily urinating).  The previous owner attempted to have this problem evaluated at a veterinarian and while the problem would resolve for periods of time, it happened repeatedly.  Based on the history, this problem is likely a behavioral problem but we recommend discussing this with your veterinarian to determine if further medical evaluation<p></p><p></p>2)  Heart murmur:  During our routine exam, a heart murmur was found.  There are currently no signs of heart disease.  In order to determine the cause of the heart murmur, a cardiac study called an echocardiogram would need to be performed.  Although many animals live normal lives with heart murmurs, it is important to discuss this with your veterinarian.<p></p><p></p>As a result of these conditions, your pet may need specialized care consisting of any or all of the below.  Please note this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.<p></p><p></p>- Special diet or prescription foods<p></p>- Prescription or over-the-counter medicines<p></p>- Regular veterinarian visits, which may include blood tests or other monitoring<p></p>- Possible surgery or other procedures as determined by your veterinarian<p></p><p></p>My caregivers have noticed that I do not seem to get along with other cats, so I may do best as the only cat in my new home. This could be why I did not always use my litterbox.<p></p><p></p><p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>"

My name is Squeaky and I am available for adoption.<p></p><p></p>I was brought in by my previous owner on June 30, 2017 because they could not afford to keep me.  My previous owner described me as outgoing, loving, and super sweet. I lived in a home with dogs, but I actually didn't like that very much. I would love to be the only pet so you can love and adore me with all of your heart!<p></p><p></p>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space. While this might change since I'm a bit skiddish in this new environment, but I will show you that I can be very sweet if you take me home!<p></p>Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>"

I am outgoing and carefree, and I just can't wait to find my forever home!<p></p><p></p>I would most like to live in a home that is &quot;low traffic&quot; so I can get all of the attention that you have to give. I can get overwhelmed by lots of commotion.<p></p><p></p>A veterinarian has diagnosed or tentatively diagnosed the above-described pet with the following condition(s):<p></p><p></p>1)    History of housesoiling.

This is most likely a behavioral issue.<p></p><p></p>2)    Soft tissue spindle cell sarcoma excised on 9/9/16.<p></p><p></p>3)   Moderate tartar on teeth.  This cat will most likely need a dental cleaning with possible extractions.<p></p><p></p><p></p>As a result of these conditions, your pet may need specialized care consisting of any or all of the below.  Please note this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.<p></p><p></p>- Special diet or prescription foods<p></p>- Prescription or over-the-counter medicines<p></p>- Special skin care or shampoos<p></p>- Regular veterinarian visits, which may include blood tests or other monitoring<p></p>- Possible surgery or other procedures as determined by your veterinarian<p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>"
